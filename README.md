# LADYCRUSHCREW: a real local climbing community

This personal project is website for a real local climbing community for ladies and non-binary climbers. Lady Crush Crew is established in 2018 by local climbers in the San Francisco Bay Area to create a safe space for climbing in a male-dominated climbing scene. 

As a freelance webmaster, I personally created the entire current [website](https://ladycrushcrew.com/) through Squarespace to ensure for the community's future expansions and growth. Their original website was made with [Wix](https://ladycrushcrew.wixsite.com/website) and they handled online purchases through email and Paypal payment requests.

For an easier business transaction for the shop, I created the Squarespace website which has a built in payment system. Other important features included were an event calendar, event registration, waivers, volunteer onboarding through a private page, blogs, donation page, contact form and volunteer sign up.

This project is the next step in creating the website from scratch through React and Typescript.
